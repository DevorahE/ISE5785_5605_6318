This project is a professional-grade 3D rendering engine implemented entirely in pure Java, without relying on any external graphics or physics libraries.

It leverages the principles of Ray Tracing, a technique used in advanced rendering pipelines, to simulate the physical behavior of light rays interacting with virtual 3D environments. 

The result is the creation of photorealistic images from mathematically defined scenes.
